Dear {{center_name}} user,

this is an automatic mail to inform you that one or more of the resources associated with your username is expiring soon. 
Expiration will terminate access to the resource for all users on the allocation. Below is the list to your project(s) containing 
at least one expiring allocation: 

{% for project_key, project_url in project_dict.items %}
Project Title: {{project_key}}
Project PI: {{ project_url.1 }}

    {% spaceless %}{% for days_key, days_value in expiration_dict.items %}
    Allocation(s) expiring in {{days_key}} days:{% for allocations in days_value %}{% if allocations.0 == project_url.0 %}  
        {% spaceless %}{{ allocations.2 }}{% endspaceless %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}
        {% endfor %}{% endspaceless %}
{% endfor %}

If any of the allocation above refers to a storage area, please note that upon expiration the project folder will be maintained 
for an additional period of 4 months and then removed. Be sure to save the data of your interest before the deadline.

To ask for an extension, login to https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/ and click on "Request Change" on an expiring allocation or
contact the HPC Help Desk for support.

Thank you,
